This repository contains the website for a game called "Duck vs Hunters," which is a card game created by a team of eight people. The game is designed for both the hunters and ducks to use different resources to play cards, such as gold for hunters and eggs for ducks. The objective of the game is to make the opponent's health go to zero. The website provides players with information about the game, including its rules, gameplay mechanics, and characters. It also offers resources to download the game and provides a platform for players to provide feedback and connect with the development team.
